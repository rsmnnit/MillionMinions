Property Registry System
Idea of Project
Illegal property buying/selling is very comman problem in India. Sometimes it causes lot of pain to genuine holder of property to rectify the resulting misconfusion of property transactions. So we came up with the idea to store all related transactions on blockchain ledger so weâ€™d have an immutable history of every property transaction that can be viewed by everyone and yet tampered by no-one. Also 2-way multi sign hybrid technique reduces the unnecessary transactions either by user or registry (Central authority). Moreover the whole thing is cryptographically secured from external attacks.
